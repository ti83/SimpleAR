# SimpleAR

This is really meant to be a simple sqlite learner project.  That said, it should be able to track ones accounts receivables and allow for a simple statement showing how much is owed.  As this is just for learning, I probably won't be adding new features to this unless explicitly requested.

First, you start by entering your services:
![Alt text](https://github.com/ti83/SimpleAR/blob/develop/documentation/services.png "Service Tab")

Then, you enter your customers:
![Alt text](https://github.com/ti83/SimpleAR/blob/develop/documentation/customers.png "Customer Tab")

Then you enter any billable service done in the ledger tab:
![Alt text](https://github.com/ti83/SimpleAR/blob/develop/documentation/ledger.png "Ledger Tab")

When it comes time to tally your bills, use the statements tab:
![Alt text](https://github.com/ti83/SimpleAR/blob/develop/documentation/statements.png "Statements Tab")
